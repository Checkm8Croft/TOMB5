# TOMB5
## PC Tomb Raider Chronicles decompilation project

Inspired by [TR2Main](https://github.com/Arsunt/TR2Main/), made by Arsunt. 

And by the [tomb5 decompile](https://github.com/TOMB5/TOMB5) project, by Gh0stblade and zdimension. 

### goals
Preserving the original source code of the PC version of Tomb Raider Chronicles.

note: All information (variable, file names, method names and data structures) have been obtained from PSX debugging symbols (.SYM, .MAP), and PC-specific function names from the Mac executable.

### Credits:
Troye: Main programmer, project leader.

ChocolateFan: Programmer, contributor.

thatguyfrombb: Additional decompiling, bug fixing, and documentation.

Raildex: additional fixes.

### Note: 
this mainly started to see if I could do it, but it blew out of proportion into a full fledged decompilation project. I only do this in my free time, and I'm still rather new at this :)
