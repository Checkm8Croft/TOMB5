# TOMB5
## PC Tomb Raider Chronicles decompilation project

Inspired by the [TR2Main](https://github.com/Arsunt/TR2Main/), made by Arsunt. 

And by the [tomb5-decompile](https://github.com/TOMB5/TOMB5) project, by Gh0stblade and zdimension. 

### goals
Preserving the original source code of the PC version of Tomb Raider Chronicles.


note: All information (variable, file names, method names and data structures) have been obtained from PSX debugging symbols (.SYM, .MAP), and PC-specific function names from the Mac executable.

### Credits:
Troye: Main programmer, project leader.

ChocolateFan: programmer, contributor.

Stohrendorf: Symdump tool creator.

### License:
This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License - see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5/blob/main/LICENSE) file for details

### Note: 
this mainly started to see if I could do it, but it blew out of proportion into a full fledged decompilation project. I only do this in my free time, and I'm still rather new at this :)
